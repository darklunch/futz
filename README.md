# FUTz: The Fair Use & Accessibility Toolkit

**FUTz** (pronounced *"foots,"* from **Fair Use Toolz**) is a client-side browser userscript that provides a suite of tools to aid **researchers, journalists, students, and users with disabilities** in accessing and reading web content.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This script does **not** perform any automatic actions. It is a user-controlled toolkit designed to help individuals exercise their legal rights under the **Fair Use doctrine** of the U.S. Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 107) and to enhance web accessibility.

## 📜 Core Principles & Legal Framework

This project is guided by the following core principles to ensure lawful and ethical use:

### 1. User-Controlled and Non-Automated

- The script performs **no automatic actions**.
- All actions must be manually triggered by the user via the menu.
- Responsibility for lawful use rests with the user, who must determine if their case qualifies as **Fair Use**.

### 2. Client-Side Operation Only

- FUTz runs **entirely in the user's browser**.
- It only interacts with **page data already sent to the client**.
- It does **not** hack, decrypt, or access private server-side content.
- It simply re-organizes or de-obstructs already-present content.

### 3. Empowering Lawful Use Cases

This toolkit is designed to support legally protected activities, including:

- **📚 Research & Scholarship**  
  Manage metered access and view content for academic analysis, citation, or synthesis.

- **📰 Journalism, Criticism & Commentary**  
  Access and verify facts, find sources, and support commentary.

- **🏫 Education**  
  Enables access for classroom discussions, projects, and academic assignments under Fair Use.

- **♿ Accessibility**  
  Enhances usability for users with visual impairments, ADHD, or other conditions through features like Reader Mode and DOM Reset.
